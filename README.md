# Alg-Team-Project
This repository contains the implementation of a movie recommendation system developed as part of a team project. The focus was on creating a cluster-based recommendation system using Kruskal’s Algorithm and other machine learning techniques to provide diverse and unique movie suggestions.

Key Features:

Algorithm Implementation:
	•	Data preprocessing with pandas and dimensionality reduction.
	•	Movie clustering using Kruskal’s Algorithm and MST (Minimum Spanning Tree).
	•	Similarity calculation and edge pruning for effective cluster generation.
 
Recommendation System:
	•	Cluster-based recommendations highlighting genre and style similarities.
	•	Random movie suggestions from clusters to introduce diverse options.

Web Interface:
	•	Interactive UI with a search bar for movies, built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
	•	Integration with TMDB API to display movie posters and details.
	•	Real-time notifications for search results.

Technologies Used:
	•	Python (pandas, NetworkX) for algorithm implementation.
	•	TMDB API for movie data and visuals.
	•	HTML, CSS, JavaScript for the web interface.
